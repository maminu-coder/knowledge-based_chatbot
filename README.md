# knowledge-based_chatbot
## A chatbot LLM trained on personal materials.
In this project, we'll use LLM to create a chatbot that will be trained on your personal data. 
The chatbot will now be able to:
- Answer detailed questions about complete educational history
- Reference specific certifications and training
- Discuss research publications and academic work
- Provide information from multiple CV versions
- Access recommendation letters and references
- Give more comprehensive career guidance based on full profile
